# python-chat-server
This project features 2 Python programs; a server and a client. To start a chat server, read follow the steps below.


### Server Setup
To start the server, run the `server.py` file with a code editor extension or with `python server.py` in a command terminal in the directory of the file.


### Client Setup
To start a client, run `client.py` the same way as in the server setup.


### Hosts
By default, the server and client are set to run on localhost (`127.0.0.1:9090`). To run on a broader network, make the server HOST your IPv4 address when you execute `ipconfig` in a command terminal and make the client HOST a the IP of the server device (can be found on https://myip.is).
